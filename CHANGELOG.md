**<details><summary>Version 0.1.2</summary>**

 - Update to README.
 - Added Moon_Day_Speed_Multiplier_Patcher and AutoScroll as dependencies.
 - Converted terrain to mesh to fix graphical issues (Thanks Voxx!)
 - Day is now slightly longer as originally intended!
 - Moon's number 360 is now part of the name as it should have been originally. This does make LethalLevelLoader treat it as a new level in the config so keep that in mind if you've messed with that stuff.
